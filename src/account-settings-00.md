# Account Settings

Account settings let you update your profile, manage security, and control
notifications.

Click your profile icon in the top-right and select **Account Settings**.

The page includes a sidebar navigation with sections such as **General**,
**Security**, **Sessions**, and **Notifications**.

## General

The General section contains settings for your profile, name, and local
development preferences.

### Profile Picture

Your profile picture shows next to your name in the dashboard and team views.

To upload or change it:

1. In the **Your profile picture** card, click the preview area (shows your
   current picture or the default user icon).
2. Select a new image file from your device.
3. The preview updates immediately.
4. Click **Update profile picture**.

To remove it and revert to the default icon:

1. Hover over (or click) the preview area – a trash icon overlay will appear if
   a custom picture is set.
2. Click the trash icon to clear the picture.
3. Click **Update profile picture** to confirm.

### Changing Your Name

Your name appears in team lists and notes.

To change it:

1. In the **Your name** card, enter your new full name in the text field.
2. Click **Change name**.

There are no restrictions on length or characters.

### Preferred Local Editor

Choose your preferred text editor for "Open in Editor" links in error
backtraces. This allows you to quickly open source files locally from Telebugs.

To set it:

1. In the **Preferred local editor** card, select your editor from the **Local
   editor** dropdown.
   - Options include **None (disable local open)** and supported editors (e.g.,
     VS Code, RubyMine, etc.).
2. Click **Update editor preference**.

### Local Source Code Paths (per project)

Configure the local path to each project's source code on your machine. This
enables "Open in Editor" links for errors from production/deployed environments
when a preferred editor is selected.

To configure paths:

1. In the **Local source code paths (per project)** card, find your projects listed.
2. For each project, enter the full local filesystem path to its source code in
   the text field.
   - A placeholder example is provided (e.g., `/Users/username/projects/project-name`).
3. Click **Update local paths** at the bottom of the card.

If you are not a member of any projects yet, a message "You are not a member of
any projects yet." will be shown instead of the form.

## Security Settings

Go to the **Security** tab for API keys, email, and password.

### Regenerate API Key

Your API key lets you interact with Telebugs programmatically.

In **Security**, click **Regenerate** to get a new one.

Copy the new key and update your integrations immediately.

### Change Email Address

Enter your new email and current password, then click **Change email**.

Verify the new email via the confirmation link sent to it.

### Change Password

Enter your current password, new password, and confirmation.

Click **Change password**.

## Log In on Another Device

The link expires after 4 hours. Do not share it.
